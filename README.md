# Hendrik Becker â€“ Freelance Backend Engineer

I design and build backend systems with a focus on long-term stability, performance, and privacy. With decades of experience in Linux-based environments, I develop custom server logic, automate infrastructure, and identify edge cases before they become issues.

I favor lean solutions over bloated stacks. Whether debugging live systems or implementing clean database logic, my approach is cautious, efficient, and security-minded. I work best in async, write-first, no-call environments, and never compromise on clarity or honesty. My communication is clear, direct, and outcome-driven. I value technical truth over personal preferences when identifying the best path forward.

ðŸš§ Currently building expertise in Go and Web3 while staying grounded in low-level protocols and infrastructure.<br>
ðŸ“¬ Open to freelance projects that value precision, autonomy, and technical depth.
